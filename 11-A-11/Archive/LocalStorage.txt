1- I created the LocalStorageController For Handling 
2- Created the Route File For the End Points  
3- Now we need to create the View Files For the Forms To make them  ; 
=====================================
Making the Env Variables for the LocalStorage and then Put the Settings For it  ; 
And Don't Forget to put the link For it  ; 
=====================================
Actually All what needed is in the Env File To make File system "Public" 
And Put the Link to the storage and then Everything is Ok 
=============================
